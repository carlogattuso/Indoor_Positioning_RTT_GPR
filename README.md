# Indoor_Positioning_RTT_GPR

**Indoor Positioning based on RTT distance project**
 
The main objective of this project is to design a fingerprinting-based indoor positioning system with an online construction of the fingerprinting database. The algorithm to model RTT observations between Access Points will be the Gaussian Process Regressor and the training data the RTT distances measured by this APs. Then, a fine-grained map can be computed without any offline calibration of the scenario.
