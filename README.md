# RTT-based Wi-Fi Fingerprinting Online Radio Map Construction

**Efficient online generation of fingerprinting radio maps for indoor spaces**

The purpose of the project is to implement a Gaussian Process Regressor to generate complete fingerprinting maps from a subset of RTT measurements in a predefined scenario. The Machine Learning algorithm must be trained with the set of observations and be able to generate the fingerprints on the rest of the radio map with the highest possible fidelity. The different project directories study different geometries of the scenario access points and the possibility of averaging the GPR input samples to improve the quality of the generated maps.
